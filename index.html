<h2>I'm Pawel Spychala.</h2>
<p>This is my home page. I am a programmer that loves to solve hard problems. I have recently specialized in the Biotechnology field to help Scientists and Researchers around the world do what they do.</p>

<h3>I'm working on VisiSim.</h3>
<p><a href="https://visisim.appspot.com">VisiSim</a> is a online simulator for many different biological processes such as signaling networks and metabolic networks. The project is written all by me in Typescript and Javascript with a simple backend written in Golang.</p>
<h3>I also maintained most of VisiScience applications.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.visiscience.com">VisiScience</a> has a multitude of products and services that were either written or maintained by me. There are a lot of different products ranging from Windows and Mac applications written in C++ to ObjC to C# to online products and services written in many different languages such as Java, Javascript, Typescript, Dart, Golang, Python, PHP, SQL, and many others. </p>
<h3>Other work</h3>
<p>I co-founded <a href="http://www.visinets.com">VisiNets</a> in 2013, which published some papers but never found any funding. I also used to create some video games in my spare time, including <a href="https://www.duelingmonkeys.com/games/karma-riot-v2.html">Karma Riot</a> (with Mike Daly), and <a href="https://www.duelingmonkeys.com/games/pinin-rodizo.html">Pinin Rodizo</a> (with Mike Daly).</p>
